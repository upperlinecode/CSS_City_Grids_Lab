# All good things come in grids...

## Intro
Your local city's planning committee has reached out to you and asked for your help with the new neighborhood they're mapping out. With your **extreme** CSS grid skills you know you can help create reactive and aesthetically pleasing layouts for the committee to use.

## Task
Choose one basic and one intermediate layout from below. Once you finish these up, try the advanced image grid challenge! You will be given all of the necessary HTML, so you only need to work in your CSS file. The layout that you choose from the basic group should be completed in basic.css, the layout from the intermediate group should be completed in intermediate.css, and so on.

Color Code:
* Gardens/Parks: Green
* Transportation: Blue
* Residential Neighborhoods: Purple
* Shopping: Pink
* Professional Buildings: Grey
* Parking Lot: Black

##### Basic Layouts
Choose one of the examples below to get yourself started. These examples will use the **grid-template-columns**, **grid-template-rows**, and **grid-gap** properties. Keep in mind the different methods you can use to designate the sizes of rows and columns, as well as how to use **repeat** to make columns or rows of equal sizes! If you're not sure where to get started, check out the glossary.md file, which contains of a list of CSS-Grid properties and ways you can use them!

##### Intermediate Layouts
Now that you've gotten your city planning feet wet, it's time to take a look at some special properties our grids can have. You'll be building out a shopping mall with plenty of stores and enough parking to keep the customers happy. You may want to consider **auto-fit**, **auto-fill**, **minmax**, and most importantly, **span** properties to complete one of the options below.

##### Advanced Image Layout
Now that you've completed the mockups requested of you, you've decided to make an inspiration board for future projects. This will display images of different cities to inspire you and get the creative juices flowing the next time you need to plan a city. You'll need to add your own classes into the html and you'll be applying all of the properties we've looked at so far. In addition, you'll need to check out the **grid-auto-flow** property...
